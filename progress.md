Original prompt: сделай главной целью игроков накопить как можно больше денег за 5 лет и каждый из 4 героев ищет пути как можно больше заработать

- TODO: Inspect existing win condition, time flow, and hero AI behavior.
- TODO: Add explicit 5-year money-maximization goal and scoring.
- TODO: Make all four heroes prioritize highest-income actions.
- Update: `createInitialState(true)` now randomizes coordinates for forests, orchards, and wild resource nodes so each new simulation starts with different object locations.
- Verification TODO: run web-game Playwright client and confirm that clicking "New simulation" produces visibly different resource placement and no console errors.
- Verification note: attempted to run `/Users/zen/.codex/skills/develop-web-game/scripts/web_game_playwright_client.js`, but runtime dependency `playwright` is missing and local install could not be completed in this environment.

- Implemented 5-year challenge completion summary with winner and ranked hero results.
- Added hero-level earnings tracking (`careerEarnings`) and persisted hero/death metadata for final ranking.
- Added explicit high-risk penalty when heroes ignore critical hunger/health while doing non-survival tasks; can trigger death.
- Updated UI overlay to show final winner and ranked results at challenge end.
- Updated wording in index.html for 4-hero 5-year objective.
- Update: Removed population birth mechanic from daily city progression; new residents are no longer spawned automatically.
- Update: Reworked World Settings modal to only contain mechanic toggles (no numeric quantity fields).
- Update: Added runtime mechanic switches (needs, trade, dynamic pricing, job rebalance, resource regeneration, construction) with save/load support via `state.worldSettings.mechanics`.
- Validation: `node --check src/js/game.js` passed.
- Validation: Ran Playwright skill client against `http://localhost:8080` with a short action burst; got `state-0.json` and `shot-0.png` in `/tmp/world-game-pw`.
- Note: Headless capture is canvas-only in this flow, so modal UI visibility was not directly asserted from the screenshot.
- TODO: Add a targeted UI automation step for clicking `#worldSettingsBtn` in full-page mode and assert checkbox states in DOM.
- Validation: Playwright run completed with 3 iterations (`shot-0..2.png`, `state-0..2.json`) in `/tmp/world-game-playtest`.
- Validation: No console error artifacts after favicon 204 fix (no `errors-*.json` generated).
- Validation gap: Challenge end overlay/winner not auto-simulated to year 5 in this run; logic verified by code paths and persisted result model.
- Cleanup: reverted repository package dependency changes after validation (Playwright remains installed in skill directory only).
- Update: Added per-player unique color assignment (`person.color`) with deterministic palette selection and backward-compatible save hydration for older states without colors.
- Update: Player rendering in simple graphics now uses each person's unique color instead of profession color.
- Update: Added color markers to the balances list in the person stats card and a selected-player color indicator.
- Validation: `node --check src/js/game.js` passed after adding player color assignment and UI markers.
- Validation: Playwright run completed with screenshots (`/tmp/world-game-playtest-colors/shot-0.png`, `shot-1.png`) and states (`state-0.json`, `state-1.json`); map render shows distinct per-player colors.
- Validation gap: This Playwright client captures the canvas only, so right-panel balance marker dots were verified by code path rather than full-page screenshot.
- Economy rewrite: selling now creates market consignments; hero income is paid only when a buyer actually purchases goods from market stock.
- Added state money printing for procurement/construction cash shortfalls; printing increases inflation index.
- Dynamic pricing now includes inflation multiplier; overlay/render text now expose inflation and total printed money.
- Construction now buys logs/food through market purchase flow (with seller payouts), and houses target one home per hero after government buildings.
- Enforced consume rule: gathered food/herbs are not directly usable; only market-purchased units (`purchaseCredits`) can be consumed.
